A BakkesMod plugin to help with practicing hoops kickoffs in freeplay.

# Usage

Plugin adds two simple features when loading a Hoops freeplay session:
1. Ball won't do kickoff motion until you move your car
2. Disables spawn location randomization and spawn can be controlled via GUI (F2 -> Plugins -> Hoops Kickoff Practice to open, or F6 -> togglemenu hoopskickoffpractice)

These features work with multiple players in either a local freeplay session or a freeplay session via Rocket Plugin (select Hoops as the game mode in addition to selecting the Dunkhouse map).

# Known Bugs

* Plugin doesn't work on the first kickoff. Just reset the ball and it should work.
* Player spawn locations don't update when new players join/leave until you reset the ball.
* Every once in awhile the kickoff motion is scuffed and either moves too fast or barely moves at all.
